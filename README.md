# HW2
## Devlog
For Minigame 2, a lot of what I drafted in the MG2 breakdown activity is reflected in the way I wrote the code and managed game objects in the inspector. I had decided to make a coin prefab according to my plan in the breakdown plan in order to have an instance of the coin object that could be cloned several times by an automated process. That process I had also decided would require a coin spawn location, which I did make in my final game as well. That spawn location lies on the right side off-screen space where the coins would generate and move towards the left of the screen. Something that did differ from my plan—due to the fact that I had forgot about it—was the use of the Randomizer method to make the coins spawn in irregular intervals. Everything else, including the sprite creation, adding colliders, and use of transform method, was pretty straightforward for the final game creation as I followed the format I had designed in the MG2 breakdown activity.
